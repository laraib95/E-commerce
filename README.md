GO Shopping: A Full-Stack E-commerce Platform
Overview
GO Shopping is a modern and responsive full-stack e-commerce web application built to demonstrate comprehensive web development skills, covering everything from user authentication and product management to secure image handling and dynamic cart functionalities. It provides a seamless shopping experience for users and a robust administration panel for managing products and orders.

Technologies Used
This project leverages the power of the MERN stack and integrates various modern libraries and services:

Frontend (React)

React.js: A declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React Router DOM: For client-side routing and navigation.
Redux Toolkit: For efficient and predictable state management across the application.
React Responsive: For delivering an optimized user experience across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript
Backend (Node.js & Express.js)

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for server-side logic.
Express.js: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database for flexible and scalable data storage.
Mongoose: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For secure user authentication and authorization.
Bcrypt.js: For hashing passwords securely.
Multer: Node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data, primarily used for file uploads.
Cloudinary: Cloud-based image and video management service for storing, optimizing, and delivering product images.
Key Features
User-Facing
Product Catalog: Browse and view a wide range of products with detailed descriptions and images.
Responsive Design: A fluid and adaptive user interface for optimal viewing on any screen size (mobile, tablet, desktop).
Shopping Cart: Add, update, and remove items from the cart with persistence.
User Authentication: Secure user registration, login, and logout.
User Profile Management: View and update user details.
Order History: (Implied, if order processing is fully implemented) Users can view their past orders.
Admin-Facing
Admin Dashboard: Dedicated dashboard for administrators.
Product Management: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for products.
User Management: (If implemented) View and manage user accounts.
Order Management: (If implemented) Process and manage customer orders.
Core Functionality
API Development: RESTful API for seamless communication between frontend and backend.
Image Uploads: Efficient handling of product image uploads to Cloudinary.
State Management: Centralized state management with Redux for a predictable data flow.
Error Handling: Robust error handling for a smoother user experience.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the GO Shopping application locally:

Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS version recommended)
npm or Yarn
MongoDB (running locally or a cloud instance like MongoDB Atlas)
Cloudinary Account (for image storage)
1. Clone the Repository
Bash

git clone https://github.com/laraib95/E-commerce.git
cd E-commerce # Navigate to the root of the cloned repository (NETSOL)
2. Backend Setup
Bash

cd backend
npm install # or yarn install
Create a .env file in the backend/ directory based on .env.example:

Code snippet

PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
JWT_EXPIRE=5d
COOKIE_EXPIRE=5

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
Replace placeholder values with your actual credentials.

Start the backend server:

Bash

npm start # or node server.js
3. Frontend Setup
Bash

cd ../e-commerce
npm install # or yarn install
Create a .env file in the e-commerce/ directory based on .env.example:

Code snippet

REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/v1 # Or your deployed backend URL
# Add any other frontend specific env variables if needed
Start the frontend development server:

Bash

npm start
The frontend application should now be running, typically at http://localhost:3000.

Deployment
The frontend is configured for deployment with Vercel. When deploying, ensure you set the Root Directory to e-commerce/ and configure any necessary environment variables on Vercel.
The backend can be deployed to platforms like Render, Heroku, or a VPS, ensuring proper environment variable configuration.
